    <h3> <font color="#ff0000">Official Rules for the 2020 Competition:
      </font></h3>
    <ul>
      <p> 1) Participants must correctly evaluate indefinite or
        definite, proper, single real variable integrals in the time
        allotted. </p>
      <p> 2) Participants will take turns working. In round 1, the first
        participant will have 2 minutes to evaluate an integral. If this
        is not done correctly, then the second participant will have 1
        minute on the same integral. If the next answer is incorrect,
        the third will have 30 seconds on this integral. If all three
        answer incorrectly, then a new integral will be given to the
        fourth contestant and the sequence repeats. If the integral is
        evaluated correctly, the next participant gets a new integral
        and 2 minutes. In round 2, the first two steps of the algorithm
        apply but the 30 second third attempt is dropped. </p>
      <p> 3) If a participant misses an integral, then he/she is
        eliminated from the competition. </p>
      <p> 4) If 5 or more contestants remain after 2 rounds, then all
        remaining contestants will compete head-to-head in one or more
        "lightning rounds" to see who can correctly evaluate the next
        integral the fastest. Depending on numbers of contestants
        remaining, there may be multiple lightning rounds. </p>
      <p> 5) At some point, a lightning round will be declared as the
        final round. The first contestant to correctly evaluate the
        integral in the final round is the integration champion. </p>
      <p> 6) Prizes will be given to all participants who make it to the
        final round. </p>
    </ul>
